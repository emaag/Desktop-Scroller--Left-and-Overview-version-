Known issues
============
* Not tested on multiple monitors.
* The one-pixel border is blocking all other non-scroll events, I cannot found
  documentation to do properly event propagation to lower actors. Anyway the
  actor is hidden while in overview mode and actor size is calculated to avoid
  block panel and notification areas.
